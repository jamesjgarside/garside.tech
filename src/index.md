## Welcome

This is my digital garage. It's a workshop and a storehouse.  It's a place for tinkering.<br>  Sometimes I come here and quietly look around at my tools and projects.<br> 
It's  like a <a href="https://henry.codes/" target="_blank">digital garden</a> but not as beautiful.  <br>More of a utilitarian "function follows form" vibe. 

Built with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), markdown, and vanilla CSS.

No tracking, no analytics, no bloat.

Deployed on Cloudflare Pages.

Inspired by [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) philosophy of owning content and controlling the platform.

Fast, simple, human-scale web publishing. RSS feeds for every topic.
